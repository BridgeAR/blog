\#futureofwork is a rather abstract term which stands for changing our workplaces from a concept that was conceived in 
the 19th century to something that reflects the needs of the 21st century humanâ€“at least for those of us who are asked 
to *produce* creatively and innovatively.

There are **a lot** of theoretical resources detailing what needs to be done to create an environment in which 
knowledge-workers can achieve their best possible output.

But there are organizations which have already arrived in *the future of work*.

At the next agile round table, which will take place on April 2nd 2015 at 
[Die Zentrale FFM Coworking Space](http://www.die-zentrale-ffm.de/), 
I'll be giving a lightning talk to show some examples of these organizations.

Sign up on [XING](https://www.xing.com/events/20-agiler-stammtisch-frankfurt-1532963) and find out that it *is* possible
to change the way we work.
