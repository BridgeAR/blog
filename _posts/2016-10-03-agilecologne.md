I was a newbie at this years [Agile Cologne XXL][1], a two-day 
open-space dedicated to the exchange about the [Agile Movement][2] so
 it was no suprise that most of the attendees were either scrum master, product owner or consultants that teach people how to fill this roles.
  
What I heard during those two days was oftentimes the question: 

> How can me and my team work in an agile fashion, if the rest of my
> organisation is not agile?
