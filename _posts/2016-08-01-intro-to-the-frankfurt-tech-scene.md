This post tries to provide an entry point for newcomers the the tech scene
in Frankfurt.

To get to know your locals, join the [{fradev} Slack channel](https://fradev.herokuapp.com/).
[{fradev}](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Frankfurt-Developers/) itself is 
currently the biggest generic group on Meetup where developers and 
of course non-developers meet.

If you are looking for a more specific topic and want to meet people that
code in your language of your choice, check out the [list of technology user
groups](https://usergroups.rheinmainrocks.de/) or [@ugsrock on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ugsrock).
With more than 100 there is no shortage of events to go to. We have days
where you had four events on on evening to attend. Gone are the days of
the early 2010s whene there was just on event in two weeks.

An important entry point to the startup scene is the [Founders Table](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Grunderstammtisch-Founders-Table-FrankfurtRheinMain/)
which meets every month. In the city of banks you can't avoid FinTech
either, the [FinTech Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/FinTech-in-and-around-Frankfurt/)
is hands-down the biggest regular meetup in Frankfurt.

The mother of all tech events in Frankfurt is the [Webmontag](http://www.wmfra.de/), now in
its 10th year, a great opportunity to connect with people that are
somehow doing things with the internet, and if you have a project or 
looking for support they always provide spotlight slots on their stage. 
A must-go once every month!

A neighbor to the Webmontag is the Hashtag [#RheinMainRocks](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23RheinMainRocks)
a lot of Tweets from the are use it to mark up local events and news 
related to the net community (Internetgemeinde) we affiliate ourselves 
with.

If you need an awesome place to work, come visit me for a coffee at 
[Die Zentrale Coworking](https://www.die-zentrale-ffm.de/) located in 
Bornheim Mitte which is the Friedrichshein of Frankfurt. Zentral offers
coworking plans from â‚¬90/mo with great coffee and awesome coworkers.

Hipsters.



If you have anything import that I've missed I'm looking forward to your
comments!

P.S.: Arguably Frankfurt is just the center of the rural are we call 
*Rhein-Main-Gebiet* so it's fair to mention that there are more and more
events happening outside of Frankfurt, namely in Darmstadt given its 
strong tech scene in connection to the local university. But given its 
central location with the biggest train station in Germany Frankfurt 
remains the gold standard for cities to run an event in.
