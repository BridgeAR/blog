![Joy, Inc.](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5754/23810492540_866c66dfd4_k_d.jpg)

I can't remember where I stumbled upon the recommendation for [Joy, Inc.â€“How We Built a Workplace People Love](http://amzn.to/1PAZgMU) 
by [Richard Sheridan](https://twitter.com/menloprez) but having read it at the beginning of this very new year couldn't
have come at a better time.

In this very well told book Richard describes how coming from a dreadful time of IT projects that were executed as
*death marches* he built [Menlo Innovations](https://www.menloinnovations.com/) based on the believe that aiming for 
*joy* would be the highest value of his enterprise. He defines *joy* as working on meaningful projects in an environment
where fear is absent and everyday actions have the purpose of delivering a product that customers love. 

This notion in itself is not surprising or new but what makes this book an exemption from the many Make-Your-Employess-
Happy-To-Build-Great-Products-Books which describe organizations that *are great places to work at* he describes what
 methodologies Menlo Innovations uses in great and applicable detail. In addition he doesn't fall short in explaining 
 how his ideas are able to enable a sustainable and growing business with happy clients while creating a working 
 environment that is free from overtime, has full vacation flexibility and leaves room for employees to engage in social 
 community and educational work.
 
*Joy, Inc.* leaves no excuse to go on the pursuit of *joy* at the workplace on your own.
