This post series is a summary of my talk about the challenge working in distributed teams
 [I held at this year's TopConf in Linz](http://topconf.com/linz-2016/trackevent/there-is-no-half-remote-team/).
 
It's a 40 minute talk so I decided to split it into three separate posts, each on focusing on one challenge:

1. [the missing watercooler](/working-remote-fix-the-missing-watercooler/)
2. [quality together-time](/working-remote-quality-together-time/)
3. [celebrate successes](/working-remote-celebrate-successes/)

This is my first conference talk and I’m happy to be speaking to you today about my experience working in remote teams.
I’ll post the ink to the slides on my twitter account @coderbyheart after the session, so no need to write anything down. 
Everything I say is also transcribed in the presentation notes.
Please don’t forget to rate this talk afterwards on lanyrd or send me feedback via Twitter.
I’m eager to hear your feedback!

A little bit about me:
I’m 35 years old and had my first webdesign company when I was still in school back in 1997.
I am a certified media designer (we call this “Ausbildung” in Germany) and have a degree in Media Computer Science.
Last year I worked as a CTO for a Fintech startup.
And the year before that I helped to launch dotHIV which tried to raise funds for the fight agains HIV/AIDS by selling domains under the top-level domain .hiv.
Currently I’m funemployed and looking for a new team.
You can follow me on twitter where I am @coderbyheart and read more about me on cto.hiv.
There you’ll also find a link to my blog where I write about leadership and software craftsmanship.
Why am I qualified to talk about remote teams?
I’ve been working in distributed teams since 2010.
Since 2012 im working 95% not on the location of the company that employs me.
The teams I worked with were small, the last one had 14 people.
By the way, this is my desk at Zentrale FFM, the only proper coworking space in Frankfurt (famous for the international airport and the European Central Bank), if you are in town come for a coffee and say hi!
… so I already have experience working in a remote team …
… and remote work is here to stay …
Probably everyone of you has at least some experience with remote coworkers and you will agree with me that this will increase even more in the future.
And I love to work remote!
So I want to make sure that your experiences working with remotees is as good as possible.
… because …
I think there are not enough opportunities for remote fanatics like me … 
And who wouldn’t love a workplace like this / (this is campground we went to last year in Harsz, Poland)?
Who wouldn’t love colleagues that are happy and are highly self-organized?
Who wants to find new hires more easily?
But having remotees on the team creates new challenges and that’s why today I want to talk about …
The 3 most important challenges when working with a distributed team and how I dealt with them …
Let’s start with the most important one: …

----

The missing watercooler.
The watercooler is a symbol for a central place in an office building where everyone walks by multiple times per day and which enables informal, accidental meetings.
How important this place is can be seen at this picture: this is the atrium in the Pixar Headquarter.
Steve Jobs himself altered the initial concept of the architect and place facilities like the restrooms, cafeterias, meeting rooms all next to each other in a central location to ensure employees need to leave their seclusion and bump into each other once in while.
For Jobs only this would enable great ideas to form, information to spread and problems to be solved quickly.
It also facilitates building relationships with your colleagues and a sense of beloning.
This obviously is lacking if you have no physical office but it is vital for every creative team to have an insight into what is happening in the whole organization.
The way to fix this is probably not new to you but I can’t stress it enough:
Start working out loud:
You need to provide your coworkers with a constant stream of information about.
What you are working on.
What your impediments are.
With this information available everyone can start making the connections to their own projects and solutions for your problem.
This can’t happen if you are away from your coworkers and only share a finished result of your work once every other week.
Obviously there is the need for a tool for that and by all means do not use email!
I am having great results by using a team chat like Slack for the asynchronous sharing of what’s happening.
Even if you don’t know Slack, you will be familiar with the concept of chat rooms, a tool like Slack enables you to have as many rooms as you like.
This is different to Skype for instance where you only have a contact list and ad-hoc group chats.
In Slack (or IRC if you like) a history of message is kept and even if people join a room at a later point, they can re-read everything that has happened regarding the topic.
Everyone is able to start following a certain topic and can contribute to it.
There are usual have three kinds of rooms:
Long-lasting general topic like #tech, #marketing and #hiring - I’d say they usually emerge around every role you have in your organisation; you could say these are communities of practice … but are also used to communicate news from these groups to the whole company in a less technical way.
Project-specific topics like #website-relaunch or #our-mobile-app in which you exchange about the progress of the project, these usually have a diverse mix of people from all disciplines.
Short-lived topics like #launch-of-big-feature, #special-event which deal usually have a high volume of exchange only for a few days and then can be discarded.
This granularity helps to better control the amount of information they will need to consume because following everything is impossible.
You need to care about this! 	
Of course we as developers have channels where every commit from our repos is posted, but I don’t get notified about every message in such a channel, I selectively read them a few times a day.
Slack enables you to specify notification settings per channel and even have different settings depending on the device so you can have more notifications if you are on your desktop or only a few important ones if you are traveling.
Make sure that the tool you are using has this type of granularity when it comes to notifications and educate all your users about them.
So much for the asynchronous part of working out loud but you will also need something that has a lot more bandwidth than text: video chat.
Everything that develops into a discussion with more than a few messages should be taken to video.
I always enjoy using Google Hangouts but if you don’t want to use Google services (like we did at my last company) you should check out Goto Meeting which is free for even more than three people and worked for my team very good.
Both services offer a screen sharing option which is a real important feature for collaboration … and a universal one; yes there is software that enables real-time collaboration directly in your apps but screen sharing is universal.
If you need to remotely fix things on coworkers computer, TeamViewer is great.
All these tools work cross-platform which you need to keep in mind, too (and I am neithor on Mac nor on Windows).
Video chat not only has more bandwith that text but it also enables nonverbal communication which is really important to fully understand each other.
We often used them to hang out together with microphones muted and listening to music but everyone could just speak up to the room if they had a question.
And sometimes people just need to vent, yes this may sound stupid but there is for instance something called rubber duck debugging which is a real thing!
Besides the ad-hoc meetings for increased bandwith and the occasional team hangout during the day I use videochat for all recurring meetings like daily stand-ups.
I call them check-ins.
Yes I know that there are tools that can collect daily stand-up information asynchronously (iDoneThis, Umantis Daily Highlights, Slack bot) but I’m convinced that you should use every chance you have too actually see and hear each other.
At my last workplace the daily stand-up happened at 12am which was the time when everyone was awake.
On a side note: even if we live in the same timezone everyones bio rythm is different.
That’s also what I love about working remote: I can organize my life around just a few fixed check-ins per week and otherwise I’m relatively flexible.
The daily standup is where everyone states what they are working on and what their impediements are.
This takes just a minute per person and should be done after 15 minutes.
Impediments need to be resolved immediately so we have reserved an additional 15 minutes after the daily for 1-on-1s to resolve any pending issues.
Everyone in the team knows to keep this slot free for adhoc meetings.
After that you can spread out again .
Because the daily stand-ups deal with detailed technical topics we only did them within people of the same profession like developers, marketing, business people.
Once a week we then had a product meeting which brought together a wider range of people, usually the product owner and if needed other specialists.
This meeting took between one and two hours on every monday and was used to plan the upcoming week and readjust the backlog.	
You could call it a sprint planning but I don’t use the classical Scrum process, I use Kanban to get the priorities straight …
Releases are done whenever neccessary, there is no hard coupling between the planning process and the deployment process.
And finally there were our weekly lunches …

----

Once a week on every Tuesday at 1pm everyone would gather together for a lunch.
This is a great meeting because of its informal nature and you have a perfect ice-breaker for free: “what are you having for lunch over there?” That’s always fun!
During the weekly lunch we’d go through every department and provide a brief update of what has happened.
Bringing everyone together again creates the opportunity for cross-chatter and random connections.
By the way: this is a large flatscreen where we connected to our remotees … what’s especially nice is that this large screen gives them a real physical presence because it provide a life-size image and a loud sound.
And yes, getting the technology right is always a pain.
You need good internet connections, good webcams (go for HD!) and good headsets … don’t go cheap on those.
But occasionally everyone of those will fail.
Usually the internet connection of one person or the chat or video service entirely … which brings me to my first …
protip: always have a fallback ready.
In our case we usually had problems with the internet connection of one of our colleagues and some times goto meeting was down.
So we made sure that everyone knew how to switch over to a telephone conference provider.
The information was available in the wiki and as soon as problems arised we quickly switched to the fallback without much waiting in order to continue quickly without to many failed attempts.
Obviously this requires you oe a) find a fallback and b) test it once in a while.
For video conferencing we used Talky as an alternative.
And alternative for a not working internet connection is using a different medium, which is phones. MyTelco provides free dial in conference rooms, and usually everyone has flatrates on their phones these days.
So many tools, I know ;-) 
That’s why, my second protip is: …
Define a communication escalation process!
What this means is that you establish a common understanding in your team, which communication tool is used for what.
At my last workplace we had these rules:
Slack is the main communication medium used to push information and to clarify questions, it is agreed upon that everyone is free to read messages in Slack whenever it suits them. It is asynchronous and everyone must be okay with the fact that there may be hours between your question and a response.
The authorative tool for managing tasks was not Slack but is Asana (a horrible task tracker, don’t use it!) this is where you create an agreement about who is doing what and when.
If you have an emergency you may call someone on his cellphone … and if you can’t answer a cell phone call you are supposed to call back as soon as possible. We also defined for the IT what classifies as an emergency. Basically only if our product was not usable by all our customers, for instance if the server is down.
There was also a special email adress you could use to report bugs that directly affect individual customers. 
We guaranteed that emails sent there would be dealt with within two hours during regular business hours.
My third protip will do wonders to your productivity. 
Have no-meeting wednesdays!
We can’t work without meetings but having one day a week where there is no meeting is a great way of establishing the value of uninterupted time for concentration.
I know this is nearly impossible for leaders, managers and sales people but your developers will love it.
I adviced my developers to add a blocking entry to their calendars during wednesdays and I also never asked them for a meeting on that day.
We even didn’t do a standup on that day.
But protip #4 is the most important one: 
Everybody should work remotely, at least some days a week.
And here is why: if you never experience working remote you won’t understand how it feels to be cut off the water cooler and to not be included in the “offline” chatter or how important great equipment is.
And this is especially true for the CEOs in every company.
Go and scout a coworking space, work from home or even more crazy: visit your remotees …
Which brings me to the second big challenge when working in a distributed team:
The few times you spend together with your employees face to face should be quality time!
If you have fixed the missing watercooler you are still not learning much about the personal quirks everyone has, but this is important for a good understanding of each others motivations and fears.
That’s why you simply must bring everyone together regularly, at least every other month.
Yes, this requires a lot of effort and it costs money!
And to focus on getting everyone to know each other better, this occasion should not be spent with business-as-usual activities.
Focus on activities that require interaction and profit off physical presence which is doing retrospectives, doing 1-on-1s or even lunch and dinner.
For us it worked best to have all-hands on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The remotees would travel on Monday and Thursday which left the weekend untouched for them and also prices for flights are lower if you don’t travel on fridays or the weekends.
And this is the important part: you need to make sure that they feel the effort of traveling is worth it.
Enter protip #5: …
Plan every hour - make their stay worthwile!
When bringing people together for an all-hands meeting it is important to not only take care of their activities during the day but the complete trip has to be planned and prepared in advance. 
You need to be their host! This may sound superfluous but I for me this is an import part of making room for the connection building part that is the purpose of these events.
Take care of their individual travel preferences.
Let them arrive on the afternoon before so they are relaxed when the all-hands starts.
Pick them up on arrival because they are usually not accustomed to the local modes of transportation. Also take care of their departure!
Organize for their accomodation: staying with colleagues is awesome, but make this opt-in only, not everyone likes having people at their homes or staying over at other peoples places. 
Pay for hotels and don’t force them to share rooms.
Plan the days but also the evening activities. 
An important side note: especially remote work is attractive for people that are introverts. Therefore it is important for every group activity you plan to keep this in mind. You should always find a polite way to offer everyone a way to opt-out of an activity or provide an alternative that allows them to recharge. 
Which brings me to the third most important challenge when working with distributed and highly self-organized teams:
Don’t forget to celebrate successes!
In an environment where we are continously pushing out changes it is hard to find clear milestones or even changes that are “big”.
If you work in an organization that is a web based business you work towards processes that allow for multiple updates per day you will have a dozend bugfixes, new features and adaptions per week.
This is good! Being able to release and adapt quickly is one of the key factors of the successfull organization.
But you lose these “ahhh we just worked months to release this thing, lets lean back and celebrate” moments.
But this is important. Celebrating and praise is something everyone will remember and also creates the understanding that everyone contributes towards a common goal.
Because it will be hard to exactly pin the moment when everyone has achieved something outstanding at the same time you as amanager need to keep track of the progress and arbitrary decide when it is time to party!
On the picture you see me during the ICANN 50 conference in London in 2015, where we celebrated with our partners and especially as a team the launch of the .hiv TLD. I will never forget this day in my entire career and even if I wore a silly hat this strengthened our bonds as a team.
I told you before that it is very important to bring people together once every now and then … obviously this is a good occasion to celebrate, too. 
But sometimes it can take a while if this is possible, so my last protip is …
Send everyone a cake!
I mean who doesn’t like cake?
… the idea is that even if your team is distributed you can organize for them to have a special gift so you can celebrate your victory via video chat on that day. 
In general you learn what everyone in your team loves and send them a present once in a while.
I once had a sys admin for whom I organized a delivery of four crates Club-Mate. GoButler is a great service for this!
The idea is to take some of your time and invest it in the happiness of your coworkers. For me this is my primary job. And yes, we can achieve this with a lot of process work, but these small things are really fun, too!
So, that’s all I have today …
Do you have any questions?
Thank you!
I hope I gave you some ideas how to bring more joy to your remote team experience!

This is a bonus slide, just in case I still have time left.
I see myself as a developer happiness advocate and yes, 1-on-1s provide a great insight into how your team is doing but I also do an anonymous questionnaire which helps to get better and usually tougher feedback.
It has 14 questions about goals & expectations, equipment & professionalism, acknowledgement, personal development, and a net promoter score.
You can find the exact questions I use at: http://blog.cto.hiv/developer-happiness-questionnaire/.
This questionnaire is based on the Book “First break all the rules”: http://amzn.to/1JYiGoB.
I let my colleagues fill out the anonymous form every other month, prior to the all-hands meetings.
I use Google Forms and give all colleagues an exact date and time when to fill out the form.
This disables any form of tracking or the possibility of assigning individual answers to team members.
During the all-hands meeting we go through the (commulated) results and talk about what we can do to improve the ratings. This is actually the most useful part of this questionnaire. It’s a great conversation starter.
The results median of all answers is used and written down in the wiki for reference and tracking the progress of the actions taken to improve the ratings.
