I'm just returning from [TopConf Linz 2016](http://topconf.com/linz-2016/) which was my first tech conference that I 
visited as a speaker. I do have quite some speaking experience but with shorter talks, usually around 15 minutes,
and in front of an audience that does not pay to attend the event. With a ticket price of €220 this conference is no
where near your usual €1,500+ that some of the bigger conferences call up but still, not a *free* event. I did visit 
some similar price conference in the past, like the [mindblowing SoCraTes](/the-magic-of-socrates-conference) or the 
[APIDays](http://apidays.io/) so I do also have made some experiences what awesome conference could be. TopConf 
unfortunately does not fully live up to it's name. 

They did manage to create a really interesting and to some extent diverse program with one workshop and eight talk 
tracks during three days. The talks that I saw had experience and well prepared speakers and were always very enjoyable 
and what I especially liked: never marketing a specific product or solution. The location was technically very well 
equipped regarding audio and presentation equipment. The WiFi was non-existent. I wasn't even able to connect to it
the whole day, so I had to buy a roaming data pass to be able to tweet-which I enjoy a lot. For me this is even more
important to connect and follow other attendees. Having no working WiFi resulted in a very low volume of tweets for the
events hashtag [#TopConfAT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TopConfAT) and basically no use of the mobile conference app
which had dedicated functionality to interact with other attendees during the conference. But given this is the first
time for TopConf to be hosted at this location this is something they are not totally to blame for.

Where I can't be that forgiving is the catering. I have never experienced something like this. What began with the 
absence of breakfast (the conference opened at 9am) and coffee only being available after the first talks were over
ended in the evening with dinner in the form of hamburger and cheeseburgers from McDonalds. This is probably the most
braindead catering option to be found, yet they failed to take care of the attendees for whom meat is not a proper
meal. This is simply rude and non-inclusive.

In the end I still enjoyed attending TopConf because I got to practice my speaking (and did some stupid mistakes doing
so, too) and got to meet great and interesting people. The TopConf staff always was very friendly and caring. The 
problems I've pointed out are easy to fix so I'll probably apply again to speak next year.
