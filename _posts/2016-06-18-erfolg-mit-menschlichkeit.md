![Womit ich nie gerechnet habe](/uploads/2016/werner-wingh.jpg)

[Womit ich nie gerechnet habe][1] is the (German) autobiography by the founder 
of _dm_, today the largest pharmacy retailer in Europe. Within 35 years, Werner 
build an organization of 30,000 employees and 2,000 stores in 2008 based on 
[anthroposophical principles developed by Rudolf Steiner][2]: putting the human 
first, within the organization but also in relation to the customer. 

The book is unique because it offers a fascinating insight into a journey of a 
founder who learned that you can run a profitable, agile and antifragile 
business while ignoring industries best practices and putting the individual 
first.

In this book Werner describes his way from a young pharmacist when he started 
seeing opportunities where others wouldn't to the CEO of a successfull pharmacy 
retailer and describes multiple occassions where the organization needed to be 
completely restructured. The reasons where never due to a crisis but due to 
Werner's strive to build a company that _serves_ its employees, customers and 
the society. By questioning the status quo and pushing for his idealistic views, 
often answered with strong hesitation by colleagues and friends, he enabled _dm_ 
to be truly agile: change was achieved by enganging everyone in the 
organization, which often took years. But because everyone _owned_ the change it 
never failed to stick. His effort to improve the human factor in the 
organization proved to be a win-win for everyone: the company never made losses, 
it holds the highest rating in independent consumer satisfaction rankings, is a 
highly favored employer and the market leader in Europe. 

Werner's legacy is proof that it is possible to build a successfull business
in a highly competitive market without sacrificing purpose and generosity. 
A business that includes the human needs and messiness into the business model 
will be at least as successfull as _classical_ meat-grinders. Examples like
the Schlecker bancruptcy showed that this approach pays off.

I recommend this book to everyone who is facing problems like high turnover 
rates, inefficiency due to bureaucracy and incompetency or is, like me, 
interested in alternative operating-systems for organizations.

P.S.: [We][RH] can help you to put the human back into your organization.
