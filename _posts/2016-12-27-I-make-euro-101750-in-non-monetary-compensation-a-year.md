*(Draft)*

Salary is probably one of the most dreadful topics, especially because it is a [hygiene factor][HF]: earning *not enough* money will affect your satisfaction greatly, but earning more than you need won't improve your performance equally strong.

Let's talk a little bit about *enough*: the actual sum that you need to live depends on your fixed costs for basics like food, rent and savings for your retirement. If you have kids or other relatives to take care of, add this on top. Once those are paid you usually spend money on vacation, hobbies, and other activities like going to a concert, eating out, etc. Your *enough* quickly amounts to a sum that is already greater then the average salary in Germany ([roughly €44,000 per year gross][GS]). But lets take that sum as *enough*.

Of course, I don't want to make what is *enough* but optimize for what *is adequate* for my position. But how much exactly is that? If we take open salary examples from around the world many feature a *market-average base-salary*: developers are rare, thus they will earn more money than accountants. It is easy to get an overview about the typical salary for your market by looking at sites like [glassdoor][GD]; for Germany the [salary overview by Robert Half](SO) is very helpful if your industry is IT. Where you are in the range depends on many factors, mostly experience, but even greater, your ability to (over-)sell yourself has a big impact on your salary especially in Germany, where you rarely find a role which compensation is made public in the job offer. The motivation to make compensations an individual agreement seems obvious: to save the company money, because they can try to negotiate the lowest possible salary for each employee. This is a fallacy, though. [Studies show][TS] that making compensation transparent within an organization, will save money.

## The gap between *enough* and *adequate* is your playing field

It's important to remember: monetary compensation has no benefit, above the individual threshhold that is perceived to be adequate. For organizations that hire talent that is in high demand it is important to understand that you need to match this threshold. **But:** the gap between enough and adequate is your playing field; you can't keep employess below their enough for a sustainable amount of time, but they are flexible in the range above that. 

Organzations can even overcompensate there, and this is what this blog post is about.
