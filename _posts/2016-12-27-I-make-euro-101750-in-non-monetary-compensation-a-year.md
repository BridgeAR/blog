*(Draft)*

Salary is probably one of the most dreadful topics, especially because it is a [hygiene factor][HF]: earning *not enough* money will affect your satisfaction greatly, but earning more than you need won't improve your performance equally strong.

## What is enough?

Let's talk a little bit about *enough*: the actual sum that you need to live depends on your fixed costs for basics like food, rent and savings for your retirement. If you have kids or other relatives to take care of, add this on top. Once those are paid you usually spend money on vacation, hobbies, and other activities like going to a concert, eating out, etc. Your *enough* quickly amounts to a sum that is already greater then the average salary in Germany ([roughly €44,000 per year gross][GS]). But lets take that sum as *enough*.

Of course, I don't want to make what is *enough* but optimize for what *is adequate* for my position. But how much exactly is that? If we take open salary examples from around the world, many feature a *market-average base-salary*: developers are rare, thus they will earn more money than accountants. It is easy to get an overview about the typical salary for your market by looking at sites like [glassdoor][GD]; for Germany the [salary overview by Robert Half](SO) is very helpful if your industry is IT. 

Where you are in the range depends on many factors, mostly experience, but even greater, your ability to (over-)sell yourself has a big impact on your salary especially in Germany, where you rarely find a role which compensation is made public in the job offer. The motivation to make compensations an individual agreement seems obvious: to save the company money, because they can try to negotiate the lowest possible salary for each employee. This is a fallacy, though. [Studies show][TS] that making compensation transparent and comparable within an organization, will save money.

## The gap between *enough* and *adequate* is your playing field!

It's important to remember: monetary compensation has no benefit, above the individual threshhold that is perceived to be *enough*. For organizations that hire talent that is in high demand it is important to understand that you need to match this threshold. **But:** the gap between *enough* and *adequate* is your playing field; you can't keep employess below their *enough* for a sustainable amount of time, but they are flexible in the range above that.

Organzations can even overcompensate there, and this is what this blog post is about. Don't get me wrong, it's not about sugarcoating low salaries by just giving them another name. It's about understanding that the money a company spends on salary can be spent—in parts—in better ways. For companies this can make a big difference, increase your runway (the amount of time until your startup goes out of business), hire more talent, invest more in new products, etc.

There is real money to make, if you find the perks, that really matter (not foosball tables and fruit baskets). To give you a concrete example, I compiled the list of my non-monetary compensations and assigned a pricetag to them.

The tricky part is, especially when talking to developers: they are bird-in-the-hand-people and it will take some effort to have this talk about a lower-then-average fixed salary with them. This will greatly affect your hiring, especially if you are secretive about your organization. Because no one will believe the advertorial speak of a founder because of what I described earlier: they expect tactics to reduce salary behind it. A better aproach will be to be open about your culture and encourage your employees to evangalize working at your company. See? Openness and transparency, they are key for the next generation of organizations.
