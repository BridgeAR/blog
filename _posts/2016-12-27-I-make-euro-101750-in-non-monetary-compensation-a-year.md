*(Draft)*

Salary is probably one of the most dreadful topics, especially because it is a [hygiene factor][HF]: earning *not enough* money will affect your satisfaction greatly, but earning more than you need won't improve your performance equally strong.

Let's talk a little bit about *enough*: the actual sum that you need to live depends on your fixed costs for basics like food, rent and savings for your retirement. If you have kids or other relatives to take care of, add this on top. Once those are paid you usually spend money on vacation, hobbies, and other activities like going to a concert, eating out, etc. Your *enough* quickly amounts to a sum that is already greater then the average salary in Germany ([roughly €44,000 per year gross][GS]). But lets take that sum as *enough*.
