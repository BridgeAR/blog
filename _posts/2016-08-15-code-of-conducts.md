*I recently launched an initiative to give the [BarCamp RheinMain](https://barcamp-rheinmain.de/) a Code of Conduct. Here is my rationale why:*

Germany is a society dominated by [CIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender) white males. Who does not acknowledge this as a deficit *is* part of the problem. If we want to change the status quo acknowledgement is the first step. A Code of Conduct [like this one](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html) with a very stark focus on sexual harrassment puts a spotlight on the fact that it is actually a huge problem how our society treats humans that do not identify with the simple black and white picture of man / woman = strong / weak. Behaviour is always influenced by experiences, only if we change the environment in which we interact with other and challenge the way how we do so, change can be achieved. In my opinion it is our duty as event organizers to take on this task. Given that out our BarCamps we welcome a many young participants we have the chance to support them in the development of their personality in a good way or at least not to harm them.

*Your every word* influences other humans. I believe it is worth scrutinizing your own behaviour.
