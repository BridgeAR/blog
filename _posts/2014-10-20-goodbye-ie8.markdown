The first commits for [our platform](https://github.com/dothiv/dothiv/) date back to April 2013. Back then Internet Explorer 7 had to be considered for [our click-counters](https://github.com/dothiv/clickcounter), and Internet Explorer 8 for the platform.

When [Windows XP was discontinued this year](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-support-help) I was happy to drop IE7 support but IE8 was still lingering around. Being now nearly two month post-launch we have enough data to justify dropping IE8 support, too.
